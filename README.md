# deep_learning_project

1. CNN project (MNIST)
2. CNN project (custom data: desk chairs / table chairs)
    -It is too easy to distinguish them because of chairs' color, so I used Grayscale in defining torchvision.transforms
    -Saving the trained model, you can test this model without training.
    -I used colab and data in google drive, so you have to add
    '''from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')'''
    on the top of the code.
